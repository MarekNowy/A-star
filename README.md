# A* Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

This repository contains an implementation of the A* (A-star) algorithm in JavaScript. A* is a widely used algorithm for pathfinding and graph traversal, particularly in applications such as GPS navigation, and robotics.

## Description

The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting point (node) to a goal in a graph, which may represent a map or a grid. It combines the advantages of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (which guarantees the shortest path) with a heuristic that allows it to prioritize exploring the most promising paths first.

### Key Features:
- Efficiently finds the shortest path in grid-based maps.
- Uses a heuristic to optimize the search.

## How It Works

The A* algorithm uses a cost function to evaluate nodes in the graph:
- `g(n)`: The cost to reach node `n` from the start.
- `h(n)`: A heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from node `n`.
- `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`: The total cost of node `n`.

The algorithm maintains a list of nodes to explore (open list) and nodes already explored (closed list). At each step, it selects the node with the lowest `f(n)` value from the open list and continues exploring until it reaches the goal.
